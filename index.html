						<p>Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something.</p>
						<p>Chop your own wood and it will warm you twice.</p>
						<p>I don’t care what you think about me. I don’t think about you at all.</p>
						<p>Work hard to get what you like, otherwise you'll be forced to just like what you get.</p>
						<p>In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.</p>
						<p>When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every
							morning is a beautiful spectacle and yet most of the audience still sleeps.</p>
						<p>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</p>
						<p>Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.</p>
						<p>There is no such thing as an accident. What we call by that name is the effect of some cause which
							we do not see.</p>
						<p>The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing really quickly, the only
							strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.</p>
						<p>Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about.</p>
						<p>Our life is what our thoughts make it.</p>
						<p>Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.</p>
						<p>The purpose of life is to live correctly, think correctly, and act correctly.</p>
						<p>As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know
							health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other.</p>
						<p>The first thing you learn in life is you're a fool. The last thing you learn in life is you're the
							same fool.</p>
						<p>Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up;
							Does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; Does not rejoice in
							iniquity, but rejoices in the truth.</p>
						<p>For true love is inexhaustible; the more you give, the more you have. And if you go to draw at the
							true fountainhead, the more water you draw, the more abundant is its flow.</p>
						<p>In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.</p>
